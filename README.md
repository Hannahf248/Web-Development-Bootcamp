# Web-Development-Bootcamp

## Description

I've created this repository to be used whilst I work through Colt Steele's Web Development Bootcamp. It will be used as a central place to store the files I create and also to help develop my understanding of Git and GitHub.

## Table of Contents

I will create a table of contents when needed as I create more files.
