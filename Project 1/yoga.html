<h1>Yoga</h1>
<p>
  <b>Yoga</b> is a group of physical, mental, and spiritual practices or
  disciplines which originated in ancient India and aim to control (yoke) and
  still the mind, recognizing a detached witness-consciousness untouched by the
  mind (Chitta) and mundane suffering (Duḥkha). There is a wide variety of
  schools of yoga, practices, and goals in Hinduism, Buddhism, and Jainism and
  traditional and modern yoga is practiced worldwide.
</p>

<p>
  Yoga-like practices were first mentioned in the ancient Hindu text known as
  Rigveda. Yoga is referred to in a number of the Upanishads. The first known
  appearance of the word "yoga" with the same meaning as the modern term is in
  the Katha Upanishad, which was probably composed between the fifth and third
  centuries BCE. Yoga continued to develop as a systematic study and practice
  during the fifth and sixth centuries BCE in ancient India's ascetic and
  Śramaṇa movements. The most comprehensive text on yoga, the Yoga Sutras of
  Patanjali, date to the early centuries of the Common Era; Yoga philosophy
  became known as one of the six orthodox philosophical schools (Darśanas) of
  Hinduism in the second half of the first millennium CE. Hatha yoga texts began
  to emerge between the ninth and 11th centuries, originating in tantra.

<h2>Goals</h2>

<p>
  The ultimate goals of yoga are stilling the mind and gaining insight, resting
  in detached awareness, and liberation (Moksha) from saṃsāra and duḥkha: a
  process (or discipline) leading to unity (Aikyam) with the divine (Brahman) or
  with one's self (Ātman). This goal varies by philosophical or theological
  system. In the classical Astanga yoga system, the ultimate goal of yoga is to
  achieve samadhi and remain in that state as pure awareness. According to Knut
  A. Jacobsen, yoga has five principal meanings: A disciplined method for
  attaining a goal Techniques of controlling the body and mind A name of a
  school or system of philosophy (darśana) With prefixes such as "hatha-,
  mantra-, and laya-, traditions specialising in particular yoga techniques The
  goal of yoga practice[57]

<h2>History</h2>

<p>
  There is no consensus on yoga's chronology or origins other than its
  development in ancient India. There are two broad theories explaining the
  origins of yoga. The linear model holds that yoga has Vedic origins (as
  reflected in Vedic texts), and influenced Buddhism. This model is mainly
  supported by Hindu scholars. According to the synthesis model, yoga is a
  synthesis of indigenous, non-Vedic practices with Vedic elements. This model
  is favoured in Western scholarship.
</p>

<h3>Origins</h3>
<h4>Linear Model</h4>
<p>
  According to Edward Fitzpatrick Crangle, Hindu researchers have favoured a
  linear theory which attempts "to interpret the origin and early development of
  Indian contemplative practices as a sequential growth from an Aryan genesis";
  traditional Hinduism regards the Vedas as the source of all spiritual
  knowledge. Edwin Bryant wrote that authors who support Indigenous Aryanism
  also tend to support the linear model.
</p>
<h4>Synthesis Model</h4>
<p>
  Heinrich Zimmer was an exponent of the synthesis model, arguing for non-Vedic
  eastern states of India. According to Zimmer, yoga is part of a non-Vedic
  system which includes the Samkhya school of Hindu philosophy, Jainism and
  Buddhism: "[Jainism] does not derive from Brahman-Aryan sources, but reflects
  the cosmology and anthropology of a much older pre-Aryan upper class of
  northeastern India [Bihar] – being rooted in the same subsoil of archaic
  metaphysical speculation as Yoga, Sankhya, and Buddhism, the other non-Vedic
  Indian systems." Richard Gombrich and Geoffrey Samuel believe that the śramaṇa
  movement originated in non-Vedic Greater Magadha.
